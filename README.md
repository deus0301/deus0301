# Hey, I’m Apoorv 👋

I’m a **game developer** who enjoys building experiences focused on **atmosphere, psychology, and player perception** rather than just surface-level mechanics. I’m especially drawn to games where something feels *off* beneath the surface, and the player slowly pieces things together through exploration and subtle storytelling.

### 🕹️ What I work on
- 🎮 Game development using **Unity**
- 🧠 Psychological thrillers & mystery-driven games
- 🏚️ Environmental storytelling and tension-based mechanics
- 👁️ Player-awareness and perception-based systems
- 📷 Experimental input mechanics using **computer vision**

### 🧩 Projects
- **The Last Clue** — Story driver escape room game. Investigation-focused experience with gradual narrative reveals  
- **Truth Unraveled** — 2D Top-Down Murder Mystery. Exploration-driven mystery with narrative progression  
- **Mercy 7.3 (Project Toxin)** — experimenting with tension, atmosphere, and player psychology. Psychological Thriller (WIP)
- **Face Runner** — an endless runner inspired by *Subway Surfers*, controlled using **computer vision**, where player movement is driven by **real-time face tracking**

### ⚙️ How I like to build
I learn by prototyping, breaking things, and iterating until the game *feels right*. I enjoy experimenting with mechanics, refining systems, and focusing on the player’s emotional experience as much as the technical side.

### 🎓 About me
- Currently studying at **Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology**
- Interested in collaborating on **indie games**, especially narrative-heavy or experimental projects
- Big fan of story-driven and psychological games
